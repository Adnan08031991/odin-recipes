<h2> How to Make Homemade Lasagna</h2>
<p>
Making homemade lasagna much easier than it looks. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below â€” but here's a brief overview of what you can expect: <br>
<br>

1. Cook the meat: Cook the ground meat in a skillet until browned and crumbly. Add the onion and continue cooking until it's translucent. Stir in the canned <br>
tomato products, half of the parsley, garlic, basil, 1.5 teaspoons of salt, oregano, and sugar. <br>
<br>
2. Cook the noodles: Boil the lasagna noodles in lightly salted water until they're al dente. <br>
<br>
3. Make the cheese layer: Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, the remaining parsley, the remaining salt, and pepper in a bowl. <br>
<br>
4. Assemble the lasagna: Layer the ingredients according to the recipe (starting with sauce and ending with mozzarella) until the lasagna is assembled. <br>
<br>
5. Bake the lasagna: Cover with foil and bake in the preheated oven for about half an hour. Remove the foil and continue baking until the top is golden brown.
